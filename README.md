## âœ¨ Features
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles applied
- Abstract classes and interfaces for flexibility
- File handling for data persistence using CSV files

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Language:** Java
- **Data Storage:** CSV files
- **Concepts Used:** OOP (Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism), File Handling, Collections (ArrayList)

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have:
- **Java JDK 8 or higher** installed
- A Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, or VS Code) or a terminal with `javac`

### Steps to Run:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-link>
